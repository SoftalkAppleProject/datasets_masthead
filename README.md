This repository contains the Softalk magazine (Apple edition) Masthead Corpus as a dataset with validating screenshots and other helpful files and information to encourage and support Citizen Science/History data exploration. 

An Excel spreadsheet is provided together with a set of exported CSV files. For data validation and to satisfy folks' basic curiosity, screenshots of the masthead pages, as they appeared in the magazine, are provided.

## A Big Thank You to Jim Salmons, Timlynn Babitsky, and Peter Caylor

Jim Salmons and Timlynn Babitsky are the driving force behind the Softalk Apple Project. Through their selfless donations of time, effort, and money, they have brought the project to life.

Peter Caylor selflessly donated his personal scan of most of the issues of Softalk, then worked diligently to secure and scan the remaining issues. His scans, for example, are making it possible for us to pull this Top 30 dataset together.
